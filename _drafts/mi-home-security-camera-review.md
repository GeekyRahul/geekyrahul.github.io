<h3>Our Review of The Mi Home Security Camera 360 1080p camera</h3>

<P>Mi Home Security Camera 360 1080p is white in color and is made of plastic. Its construction feels sturdy and durable. It has a slightly dome shape. Due to its color it perfectly blends into the surroundings. The speaker of the camera is located on the back side. The MicroSD card slot is underneath the lens area. You have to move the camera vertically up in order to access it.</P>

<P>The slot to connect the adapter and a reset button is located near the base on the back side of the camera. Around the lens the camera has 8 Infrared LEDs to support night vision. The night vision mode has a range 10m but in our testing we installed the camera on the balcony on the upper floor and had no problem getting the gate and the road in front at night. So in the recommended range of 10m you will get clear and high quality night vision. But at much farer distance the quality would drop but still it is enough for a security camera. We have included footage at various conditions in this review. The camera supports two audio and has a Talkback feature. What this means is you can talk to anyone near the camera through the app. That is why there are speakers on the back of the camera.
Since the camera runs on 5V & 1A you can even power it with a power bank, I don't see any reason why you might do that but if you want you can do it.</P>

<P>You can store around of 3 and a half days footage with a 32 MicroSD card. The camera will automatically overwrite old footage to make space for the new footage. </P>

You can rotate the camera using the Mi Home App. The camera can be rotated 360 degree horizontally. It cannot rotate in a complete circle like a fan.      

During our testing we left the camera on for more than 20 days and found no issues at all. The camera was placed in a position that receives direct sunlight during the day. So far we have faced no issues. So the product is very much durable.



Setting the camera up for use is very easy.All you have to do is download Mi Home App. Login or create an account. Then click on add devices select the camera. Make sure that the camera is powered on. Now you will see a QR code on your mobile app. You have to place
